## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help us enhance our problem-solving skills by
`building practical tools` (that actually we can use).

---

## Tools List

There are `README.md` files for each tool in the `cmd` directory.

- [SNS Message Sender](./cmd/sns/README.md) (yanmoyy)
  - Send an SNS message on terminal
- [PPT Crawling](./cmd/ppt-crawling/README.md) (kaeba0616)
  - Crawl a PPT file and save it as HTML file.

### Problems (Not Yet Solved)

Add a topic or problem to the list before implementing. At the end of the day,
our problems will be part of automation.

- I want to order my daily sandwich at the same time every day.
