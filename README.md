## Purpose

The goal of this project is to enhance our `problem-solving` abilities through
the development of `functional tools` (that actually we are going to use).

## Tools List

Explore the tools in progress within the `cmd` directory, each with its own
`README.md`:

- [SNS Message Sender](./cmd/sns/README.md) (yanmoyy)
  - Send an SNS message on terminal
- [PPT Crawling](./cmd/ppt-crawling/README.md) (kaeba0616)
  - Crawl a PPT file and save it as HTML file.

### Problems (Not Yet Solved)

Contribute by adding new problems or challenges to the list before implementing
solutions. Our goal is to turn these problems into automated solutions over
time.

- I want to order my daily sandwich at the same time every day.

### Contributing
