# PPT CRAWLING

## Purpose

- I want to create animation to select item from a list.

  - So I make a cli tool to select item with animation and coloring.
  - And I will use this tool with other tools when I have to select item.

## How to setup

   - 3-1. just **go run** command

     - `go run ./cmd/select-item/main.go`
